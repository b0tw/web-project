# web-project

## Specifications

The theme of the project is anonymous grading web application. We will be working
in the frontend with React, while on the backend with NodeJS and Express.

The features of the application are the ones in the theme requirements:

- A student member can add a project and a series of partial deliverables for the
project
- The project and the deliverables can have demonstrative videos and/or other
links shown
- When the first deliverable is due for a project, a jury is selected from the
other teams; the jury for a project will grade the final project
- The grading is from 1-10, with a maximum of 2 decimals and anonymous; the final
grade is computed by eliminating the lowest and the highest grade and averaged it
- The professor will see the final grade for each project and deliverable
- Grades can be modified only by their owner and only for a short period of time

## Project plan

The plan is to work by adding gradually fully-implemented features (backend + frontend).
The work for each individual feature will be done on a separate branch.
